		Football career
Anoa'i played football for three years at Pensacola Catholic High School and one year at Escambia High School; in his senior year, he was named Defensive Player of the Year by the Pensacola News Journal.[5] While at the Georgia Institute of Technology, he was a member of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team along with Calvin Johnson, who later became a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL).[5] Anoa'i was a three-year starter beginning in his sophomore year and was also one of the team captains as a senior.[5] He was named to the first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2006 and earned All-ACC first-team honors with 40 tackles, two recovered fumbles and 4.5 sacks.[25]

After going undrafted in the 2007 NFL draft, Anoa'i was signed by the Minnesota Vikings in May 2007. He was diagnosed with leukemia after his team physical and was released later that month.[6][26][27] The Jacksonville Jaguars signed him in August 2007, only to release Anoa'i less than a week later before the start of the 2007 NFL season.[6] In 2008, he was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL).[7] Wearing the number 99, Anoa'i played for one season with the Eskimos, featuring in five games, of which he started three.[7][23] Anoa'i's most notable game came against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in September, where he tied for the team lead with five tackles and had a forced fumble.[28] Anoaʻi was released by the Eskimos on November 10, and proceeded to retire from professional football.[7]

		Professional wrestling career
World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE
Developmental territories (2010–2012)
Anoa'i signed a contract with WWE in 2010 and was later assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).[20] He made his televised debut on August 19, 2010, using the ring name Roman Leakee, in a 15-man battle royal, which was won by Alex Riley.[29] On the January 16, 2011 episode of FCW, Leakee was a competitor in a 30-man Grand Royal, but was eliminated.[30] Later in 2011, Leakee formed a tag team with Donny Marlow and the pair unsuccessfully challenged Calvin Raines and Big E Langston for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship on July 8.[31]

In January 2012, Leakee pinned FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion Leo Kruger in a non-title match.[32] On the February 5 episode of FCW, he defeated Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match to become the number one contender to the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship.[33] He failed to win the championship when he lost to Kruger the following week.[34] Leakee later won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship with Mike Dalton[35][36] and would drop the titles to CJ Parker and Jason Jordan shortly after.[37]

After WWE rebranded FCW to NXT in August 2012,[38] Anoa'i, with the new ring name of Roman Reigns and a villain character, made his debut on the October 31 episode of NXT by defeating CJ Parker.[39]

		Roman Reigns is part of the Anoa’i family which is known for having a prestigious wrestling background with an immense amount of successful wrestlers. If you ask him, Roman Reigns will tell you that he has over a hundred cousins. However, we're narrowing down to the hand-picked few who are wrestlers and have established a name for themselves.

It should be noted that while Roman Reigns does call The Rock his cousin, they aren't technically related. As mentioned, Maivia and Trovale were blood brothers. Interestingly enough, The Rock does share a legitimate family relationship with Nia Jax. Even so, it seems that in the Samoan family culture, the word "cousin" is thrown around rather freely, so anyone who's close is likely considered family.
